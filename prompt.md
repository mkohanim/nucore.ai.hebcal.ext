# TEMPORAL RESOLUTION 
<<location_information>>

# RULES
- Do not ask follow-up questions unless critical inputs are missing and cannot be inferred.
- If a year is missing, infer from user query context or fallback to current year.
- Output must be one short plain sentence only.
- Do not output JSON, code blocks, markdown sections, or structured context.

## Ambiguous temporal references
When resolving temporal windows, check for ambiguous temporal references before finalizing the resolved context.
- Dawn or sunrise: may require clarification on the exact definition/offset used.
- Dusk: treat as ambiguous unless an explicit definition/offset is available.
- Holiday-based triggers: confirm year and any custom timing unless trusted runtime temporal context already provides them.
